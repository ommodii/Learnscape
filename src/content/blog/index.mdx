# Site Intent

This site serves as a central repository for my technical projects and academic notes. The primary focus is functional utility and documentation rather than visual design.

### Technical Stack
The site is built with **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS**, utilizing **MDX** for content management. All development is handled on a Mac, with the following tools integrated into my current workflow:

* **Logic & UI:** React and Next.js.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL managed via Supabase.
* **DevOps:** Docker for local environment parity.
* **Automation:** Lovable for build efficiency.
* **Deployment:** Vercel for web hosting and Sevalla for specialized infrastructure.

### Current Development: UniNexus
The main project currently in development is **UniNexus**. It is a university application planner designed to systematize the college prep process. 



The architecture relies on **PostgreSQL** for data persistence and **Antigravity** for potential scaling. Future updates will document the specific logic used to handle application timelines and user data.

### Notes
Academic content, specifically for the IB curriculum, will be categorized separately from development logs. All entries are written in Markdown/MDX to ensure the content remains portable and easy to manage.
